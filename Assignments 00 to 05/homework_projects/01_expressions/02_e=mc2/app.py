Program: Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence ðŸ’¡
---------------------------------------------
This program continuously asks the user to enter mass (in kg) and calculates 
the equivalent energy using Einstein's famous equation: E = m * c^2.

The speed of light (C) is considered as a constant: 299,792,458 m/s.
